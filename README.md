<strong>Title - Travel Journal</strong>

This is my very first React project. In this project a static web page is built using React, where React renders the datas in a repitative pattern from the data array stored in a data file

This projects shows how using props components can be reused

__This project uses__

- .map()

- Props

- spread syntax

Dev Dependencies:

React

React-DOM
# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
